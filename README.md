## Project Overview

The eNotes CRUD web project allows users to manage their notes by performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. Users can easily add new notes, view existing notes, edit notes, and delete notes they no longer need.

## Features

### Create

Users can create new notes by filling out a form with a title, description and tag. After submitting the form, the note is added to the Your Notes Section.

### Read

Users can view a list of all their notes on the main page. User can read all notes right there.

### Update

Users can edit the content of an existing note. They can click an "Edit" button next to a note, make changes, and save the updated content.
